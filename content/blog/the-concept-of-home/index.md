## 家 vs. 家

In Mandarin, the words for house and home   
are one and the same.   
And still, there is distinction between the two.    
Yes, 家 can be bought and built and renovated,  
but they require an immeasurable amount     
of love to become a home. 

家 means love and warmth    
and so much more.   
You could return to your house      
after a long day    
but you would rather    
go home instead.    

When someone tells you, ‘我回家了’ [*I am going home*],   
you do not know which home she means. 

家乡:   
It could be the one in her family’s village,    
where generations share stories of long ago     
around a table that creaks      
under the weight of a feast,    
of braised pork belly and fried fish    
and mountains of sweet sticky rice.     

新家:   
It could be the one where she lives now     
in the city with the family she’s started,      
where the walls are filled      
with the sound of       
her children’s laughter     
and the love her husband has    
for the life they’ve built together.    

老家:       
It could be the one from her childhood—     
that she only revisits in hazy golden dreams        
of snowy Saturday mornings      
and cherry blossom springs.         

When my hair turns white,       
when my bones ache,     
when my sight fades,        
and when my memory flees,       
I hope to measure my happiness,         
Not by the 家 I have owned and sold,        
but by the number of        
家 I have made.
