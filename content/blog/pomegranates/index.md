## deciduous trees lose their leaves

Pomegranates are deciduous. Any two-second search on Google will tell you that. 


## june 2020 

When I graduated high school last June, my mother purchased a pomegranate tree. It’s a little generous to call it a tree. To me, it was more like a scraggly bush that came no higher than my knee. 

For my sister's graduation four years ago, she had purchased Carolina jasmine. It thrived and climbed across the garden walls, blooming in soft, pink flowers every spring and summer. 

I didn’t understand why my mother had chosen a pomegranate tree. We barely buy pomegranates as is, even when they’re sweetest in autumn. Besides, that one squirrel that likes to terrorize our backyard would probably end up stealing all the fruit our tree bore. 

Living in Southern California means that I’ve lost all understanding of seasons, and when the pomegranate tree lost its leaves in October, just as I was turning eighteen, I thought it was dead. The rational part of me knew it was deciduous—but *what if* it was dead? Had some unknown disease turned its leaves a sickly yellow? 

It was then that I realized I had become overly-emotionally invested in this tree’s growth.  

I wondered if we should dig it up, replace it with something else. It didn’t look like its leaves were growing back. Besides, when had I ever seen a deciduous tree lose its leaves in Southern California? 

My mother told me to be patient. 

In February, tender red-green buds began to appear, reaching towards the new year’s late winter sun.

I’m happy to report that nearly a year later, it now stands taller than me. 

Why am I writing about this? Maybe it's because it reminds me of the tree outside my Grade 2 classroom in Burnaby. For two years, it never grew, but one day, glossy, light green leaves finally started to sprout over the dark branches. Is there a moral to this story? Should I have been more patient? Put more faith in Google? Is this some symbolic reminder of finding resilience? 

I have no idea, but it just felt really good to see the tree start growing again.
