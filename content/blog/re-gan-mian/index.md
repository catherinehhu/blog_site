## childhood in a bowl 

May is one of my favorite months—it's the last full month of classes before summer officially begins, a time I associate with (in a pre-pandemic life) weeks-long trips to China, where the summers are full of mosquitoes, 90% humidity, and temperatures that run to upwards of 40 degrees Celsius. More importantly, visits to China mean meals with family. 

During my last visit in 2019, I remember sitting on sticky plastic stools inside (no, there was no AC) a crowded little restaurant in Wuhan with my aunt as we devoured a bowl of re gan mian for breakfast. It was my grandpa's favorite meal—I remember eating it with my family in the university cafeteria. 

Re gan mian is a Wuhan specialty, with springy noodles coated in a mixture of sesame paste and soy sauce, then topped off with pickled vegetables (long beans, carrots, etc.), green onions, chilli oil, and more. It's thick, sticky, and best eaten in the middle of summer. 

Recently, I found myself craving it badly. We'd run out of sesame paste at home, so I made my own version: peanut butter mixed with sesame oil and soy sauce, green onion, pickled radish, zha cai, and a little Lao Gan Ma, the iconic chilli crisp brand that dominates every Chinese grocery store in North America. 

Even when I do make re gan mian with all the *right* ingredients, it never tastes the same. It's best eaten with my extended family as we wander through bustling summer cities.
