## reflecting on 365 days of chaos and change

i've seen these all over instagram, twitter, and linkedin, but they don't feel like the *right* place for me to put my own year in review. 

my [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/-catheriiine?si=cac3aac281704aad) wrapped told me my music choice was wistful and confident, which i thought was a strange combination. a mix between longing for the past and an eagerness for the future. it makes sense for me, i suppose. maybe i'm just a strange person in general. 
- january: shifted my morning routine to a 5:30 am start, with 6 am sunrise walks and cooking excessive noodle soups for breakfast.  
- february: started driving for the first time since i passed my test in high school. very fun. 
- march: honestly, the period between march and august was kind of a blur, but i wrapped up my second quarter at ucla. had a happy accident of scheduling classes with finals crammed into the weekend before finals week, so my spring break was twice as long as everyone else's. 
- april: the highlight of this month was a trip to san diego (i drove!) and visiting flower fields. i am a massive fan of flowers. downside was the sunburn. 
- may: got to work on some new projects through clubs/ucla. met a lot of amazing people (albeit over zoom). visited some ucla friends for a weekend :)
- june: took some psych classes over the summer for fun. 
- july: got back into baking cookies and foods. the library reopened. got to explore more of socal! 
- august: reconnected with childhood friends. that was exciting. visited my high school and was terrified by how small all the children looked. i've never felt older in my life. 
- september: got a concussion and went to the er for the first time (exciting stuff). made it onto the ucla campus for the first time! an in-person quarter! what a delightful change. ucla dining is s-tier. 
- october: consistently fell asleep in my software development class and created a tradition for myself involving one latte before each lecture. 
- november: got really, really burnt out. to be frank, november was not a fun month for me. learnt the hard way that self care is hugely important. thanksgiving! it was exceptionally jarring to be back in my hometown. everything was *so quiet*. how had i spent half my life in silent suburbia before college? 
- december: wrapped up my first in-person quarter. replenished my sleep (i have a theory that i can survive on minimal sleep for extended periods of time as long as i hit a certain quota of hours within a few weeks, ie. 3 months on 5-6 hours + 3 weeks of 12 hours/night. has been really effective thus far, but we'll see). 

notes: the two weeks between late august and early september were my favorite. i started exploring coffee shops throughout my town and did work in aesthetic cafes. i also fell in love with driving during this time. 

my favorite songs that i listened to this year on repeat (both new and old): 
- Girl of My Dreams (Juice WRLD, SUGA)
- 'tis the damn season (Taylor Swift)
- Clean (Hey Violet)
- Elvis Song (Maisie Peters)
- Roses (Boy in Space)
- dna (LANY)
- Throw Me in the Water (WILD)
- Ya'aburnee (Halsey)
- blue bird (Zachary Knowles)
- what are we (Virginia to Vegas)
- When This is Over (Dabin, Nurko, Donovan, Woods)
- The Road Home (Stephen Paulus, Conspirare, Craig Hella Johnson)
- Marias voggesong (Max Reger, Trygve Brøske, Unni Boksasp, Cantus, Bendik Lund Haanshus, Magne Vestrum, Tove Ramlo-Ystad) 
- Loch Lomond (musica intima)
- 鸿雁 (呼斯楞)
- 荷塘月色 (凤凰传奇)
- 刚好遇见你 (李玉刚)

the best books i read this year: 
- *The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo* (Taylor Jenkins Reid)
- *The Immortalists* (Chloe Benjamin)
- *Wintering* (Katherine May)
- *The Four Winds* (Kristin Hannah) 
- *Nervous System* (Lina Meruane)
- *Project Hail Mary* (Andy Weir)
- *Ariadne* (Jennifer Saint)

this year was a wild one. so much professional, academic, personal, and emotional growth for me. more ups and downs that i can possibly even count, but i'm grateful for each and every one of them for shaping me into the person i am now. 

here's to 2022.
