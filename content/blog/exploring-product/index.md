## finding product

When I was in fifth grade, I told my mother I wanted to be a full-time author when I grew up. Naturally, she had a better understanding of the job market and job security than I did and suggested I become a lawyer because ‘they write, too.’ 

I mean, she wasn’t wrong, but I wanted to write stories about dragons and wizards, not opening arguments and pretrial statements. 

But I had recently watched Legally Blonde and allowed myself to be swayed into the glamor and excitement of law that the movie seemed to portray. 

In a way, learning about law and working on Mock Trial helped me strengthen my narrative building skills, but it still wasn’t the right path for me. 

In my sophomore year of high school, I found myself immersed back in the world of STEM, hellbent on becoming a chemical engineer. Until. I. Realized. That. Was. Also. Not. For. Me.  

Now I’m at UCLA staring at my computer science professor’s screen as he types out C++ syntax in his Microsoft Word doc. And I find myself missing the storytelling aspect that came with crafting a cohesive defense argument and with building my own fantasy worlds. 

Exploring product through companies and student organizations gave me exposure to software development, design, and strategy. It allowed me to interact with users, understand them, communicate their needs to a team, and build a solution—it’s the exact same logic that developing a narrative requires. It was truly the first time that I felt like my messy list of interests could finally fit together into a somewhat cohesive way.
