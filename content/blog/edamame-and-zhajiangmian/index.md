## visiting wuxi

An elderly man with greying hair sits in an old tank top at the dining room table in the middle of a sweltering Wuxi summer day, shelling edamame beans. The slippery beans that his rheumatic fingers have carefully extricated from their pods land in a plastic bowl with a dull thud. The ceiling fan whirs, attempting to cut through the thick, muggy air in vain. The cicadas buzz outside, their nonstop noise coming through the open windows of the apartment. 

An elderly woman with carefully permed hair chops the doufu gan and zha cai and slices the cucumbers into narrow strips. She mixes a sesame paste sauce and sets it aside. In a saucepot, she heats up oil, and adds the soybean paste, ground pork, tofu, zha cai, and the other sauces, simmering them until they’ve melded into a rich, dark sauce. When the knock at the door comes, she shuffles in her pink slippers to open it—on the other side stands her daughter and her two granddaughters, arrived after a long flight from across the Pacific. 

Hugs, laughter, smiles are exchanged, the delighted sound of their grandchildren greeting their grandparents as popo and gonggong in their joyous voices. She heads into the kitchen to cook the noodles fresh, shaking off their excess flour before dropping them into a boiling pot of water. 

At the dining table, there’s a bowl of cucumbers, of zhajiang, of noodles, and of edamame. Scoops of each go into every bowl—and she watches in amusement as her grandchildren slurp up every last noodle. They’d missed her cooking so, so much.
